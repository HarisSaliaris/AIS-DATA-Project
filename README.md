# AIS-DATA-Project

Datasets from (Link): https://zenodo.org/record/1167595 were used in order to study the speed of the vessels, in addition to the weather conditions of each time period. More specifically, the location for the vessels is known on each time period, so the closest weather station can be found, that will provide us with the weather condition present each time period for each vessel. Also a DecisionTreeRegressor prediction algorithm is used in order to predict the beaufort at a certain time.
